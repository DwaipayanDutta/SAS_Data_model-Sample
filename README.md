# SAS Data Model Sample: Logistic Regression with Synthetic Data

This repository demonstrates the creation of a logistic regression model in SAS using synthetic data generated by a Python script. The model aims to predict a binary outcome variable based on several predictor variables.

## Overview

Logistic regression is a widely used statistical method for binary classification. This project provides a step-by-step guide to generating synthetic data, building a logistic regression model in SAS, and evaluating its performance.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model used for predicting binary or categorical outcomes. It estimates the probability of an event occurring based on one or more predictor variables. The model fits a logistic function to the data, which is a sigmoid curve that maps predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1.

The logistic regression equation is:

$$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n$$

where:
- **p** is the probability of the event occurring
- **β₀** is the intercept term
- **β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ** are the coefficients for each predictor variable **x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ**

## Information Value

Information value (IV) is a measure of the predictive power of a variable in a binary classification model. It quantifies the difference between the distributions of good and bad events for each predictor variable. A higher IV indicates that a variable is more predictive of the target variable.

The formula for IV is:

$$IV = \sum_{i=1}^n (Good_i - Bad_i) \times \log\left(\frac{Good_i}{Bad_i}\right)$$

where:
- **n** is the number of distinct values for the predictor variable
- **Goodᵢ** is the proportion of good events
