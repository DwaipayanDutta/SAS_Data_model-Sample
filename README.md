## Overview

Logistic regression is a popular statistical method for binary classification problems. This project guides you through generating synthetic data, building a logistic regression model in SAS, and evaluating its performance.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used to predict binary or categorical outcomes. It estimates the probability of an event occurring based on predictor variables. The model fits a logistic function to the data, resulting in a sigmoid curve that maps predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1.

The logistic regression formula is:

$$
\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n
$$


where:
- **p** is the probability of the event occurring
- **β₀** is the intercept
- **β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ** are the coefficients for predictor variables **x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ**

## Information Value

Information Value (IV) measures the predictive power of a variable in binary classification models. It quantifies the difference between the distributions of good and bad events for each predictor variable. A higher IV indicates better predictive capability.

The formula for IV is:

$$
IV = \sum_{i=1}^n (Good_i - Bad_i) \times \log\left(\frac{Good_i}{Bad_i}\right)
$$


where:
- **n** is the number of distinct values for the predictor variable
- **Goodᵢ** is the proportion of good events for the i-th value
- **Badᵢ** is the proportion of bad events for the i-th value

## Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix provides a summary of a classification model’s performance. It displays the counts of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) for a binary classification task.

The confusion matrix is structured as follows:

|                    | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | TP                 | FN                 |
| **Actual Negative** | FP                 | TN                 |

From this matrix, various performance metrics can be derived, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started

To build the logistic regression model in SAS with synthetic data, follow these steps:

1. **Generate Synthetic Data**: Run the Python script `data_generator.py` to create the synthetic dataset. ![Python Icon](https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/919/919852.png)
2. **Import Data into SAS**: Load the generated data into SAS. 📊
3. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand relationships between predictors and the target variable. 🔍
4. **Split the Data**: Divide the data into training and validation sets. 📈
5. **Train the Model**: Use the training data to build the logistic regression model. 📉
6. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the model using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, and the confusion matrix. 🏆
7. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Adjust the model parameters if needed and re-evaluate. ⚙️
8. **Deploy the Model**: Apply the final model to make predictions on new data. 🚀

## Usage

To generate synthetic data and model execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Master_File.py
